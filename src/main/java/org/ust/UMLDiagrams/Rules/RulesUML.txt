Key Rules for UML Class Diagrams:

Classes are represented by rectangles divided into three sections:

Top section: Class name
Middle section: Attributes
Bottom section: Methods


Attributes and methods are listed with their visibility:

(+) public
(-) private
(#) protected


Relationships between classes are shown with different types of lines:

Association: Solid line
Inheritance: Solid line with a hollow triangle arrow
Aggregation: Solid line with an unfilled diamond
Composition: Solid line with a filled diamond
Dependency: Dashed line with an arrow


Multiplicity is indicated near the ends of association lines (e.g., 1, 0..1, , 1..).

Now, let's look at two examples:
Example 1: Library Management System
UML Class Diagram: Library Management SystemClick to open diagram
This diagram shows three classes: Library, Book, and Member.

The Library class has a one-to-many relationship with both Book and Member classes, indicated by the "1" and "*" notations.
Members can borrow multiple books, and books can be borrowed by multiple members,
shown by the many-to-many relationship between Member and Book.
Attributes and methods are listed with their visibility (+ for public, - for private).

Example 2: Online Shopping System
UML Class Diagram: Online Shopping SystemClick to open diagram
This diagram illustrates:

A Customer class that can place multiple Orders (one-to-many relationship).
An Order class that contains multiple Items (composition relationship, shown by the filled diamond).
A Customer has one ShoppingCart (one-to-one relationship).
The ShoppingCart can contain multiple Items (one-to-many relationship).
