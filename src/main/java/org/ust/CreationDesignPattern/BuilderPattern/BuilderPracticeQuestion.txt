Flight (e.g., "Business", "Economy", etc.)
Activities (Optional, e.g., "Sightseeing", "Scuba Diving", etc.)
Meals (Optional, e.g., "Breakfast only", "All-inclusive", etc.)
Create a VacationPackage class with the following attributes:

destination: String

Your task is to:

Implement the VacationPackageBuilder class using the Builder Pattern.
